Ph.D. in Computer Science with extensive experience in analytics, modeling and quantitative finance
looking for short term contract products while waiting to relocate.

My main language now is Python (with Pandas, NumPy, ScyPi, ...).
I have also used R extensively and I have coded in both C/C++ and Java but not in a few years.

Also very proficient in SQL

Analytics and Modeling experience includes
* regression (OLS, regularized, tree based, ...)
* classification (trees, logistic, SVM)
* clustering (k-means plus many other variants)
* time series analysis
* visualization (Spotfire, Bokeh by Continuum, plus ggplot in R)

Also vary familiar with all the less glamorous steps in an analytics project such as data gathering, data cleansing, dealing with missing data and outliers, writing up results, et cetera.

Knowledge of other AI/Machine Learning methods such as Neural Nets, Deep Learning, tensor flow, NLP
  so willing to work on projects involving these at a reduced rate.
The same is true for Spark.
