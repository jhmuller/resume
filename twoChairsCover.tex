\noindent
I am a computer scientist and data scientist with over 15 years of experience in areas such as:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
 \item algorithm design and implementation,
 \item analytics \& data science, and
 \item data visualization.
\end{itemize}

I have worked on a variety of application domains including image compression, retail forecasting, retail banking, risk management, asset management and most recently recommendation systems.

I have coded applications in a variety of languages, but for most or my recent work I have used the Python ecosystem (pandas, numpy, sklearn, Keras/tensorflow, pytorch, etc.)  with SQL and occasionally R.
\vspace{0.1in}

I have been doing data science for over 10 years not only at work but also via 
\begin{itemize}
 \item courses, e.g. online from Stanford, CMU or MIT.\\
 I recently completed courses with Stanford online for the AI certificate, this included course on AI, machine learning and graph machine learning.
 
 \item seminars, e.g. from the authors of Elements of  Statistical Learning \\
     \hspace*{.4in}  \>   or on visualization from Stephen Fry and Ed Tufte.
  \item projects, mostly using Python, sklearn and tensorflow or Pytorch. \\
    \hspace*{0.2in} For recent projects please see {\em {http://github.com/jhmuller/jhmuller.github.io}}
\end{itemize}



\noindent I would love to speak with someone about how I could bring all of my skills and experience \\
to contribute to your goal of improving the quality and coverage of Mental Health Care in this country.
