\noindent
I am a computer scientist and data scientist with over 20 years of experience in areas such as:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
 \item algorithm design and implementation,
 \item analytics \& data science, and
 \item data visualization.
\end{itemize}

I have worked on a variety of application domains including image compression, retail forecasting, retail banking, risk management, asset management and most recently recommendation systems.

I have coded applications in a variety of languages, but for most or my recent work I have used the Python ecosystem with SQL and occasionally R.

Below is a sample of some of the Data Science, Machine Learning or AI projects I have worked on.

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
\itemsep0em
\item Personal projects
    \begin{itemize}
  \item  Predicting the number of jobs added in the US.
     \item Analysis of Asset Manager holdings, using SEC 13-F filings.
 \end{itemize}
 \item Part of online coursework:
    \begin{itemize}
       \item  Image classification.
       \item Search tree algorithm for games.
       \item Collaborative filtering and matrix factorization for recommendations.
\end{itemize}        
\item  Consulting
 \begin{itemize}
     \item Clustering survey responses to find “natural” groupings.
     \item Survival Analysis for customer attrition.   
  \end{itemize}       
\end{itemize}

%Other topics I am actively exploring are: Hidden Markov Models, Causal %Models and Machine learning for graph data.   \linebreak

Due to health issues starting in 2018 my career was sidetracked, hence the gap in my resume.
I am happy to say that I have rebounded. In 2021 I organized an online seminar through Deeplearning.ai, \emph{Migrating to Deep Learning},
to explore/discuss how technical people with experience in Data Science can get started in Deep Learning.


I recently completed courses with Stanford online for the AI certificate, this included course on AI, machine learning and graph machine learning.
