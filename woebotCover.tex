\noindent
I am a \textbf {computer scientist, data scientist and finance quant} with years of experience 
in areas such as:
\vspace{-.1in}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
 \item quantitative finance, 
 \item analytics, data science, \& data visualization, and
 \item algorithm design \& implementation,
\end{itemize}

\noindent I have worked on a variety of application domains 
(e.g. image compression, retail forecasting and more).

\noindent It has always been a dream of mine to use my skills and experience to make the lives of people suffering with mental health issues better.
For example, I have looked into how the process of selecting an antidepressant can be made more precise
so that fewer alternatives need to be explored.

\noindent I also know that getting access to any therapy at all  can be challenging and finding effective and successful therapeutic treatments often involves several false starts.

\noindent
Since yuor mission and my passion align, I would love to speak with someone there about how I could bring all of my skills and experience \\
to contribute to the cause.

\noindent Best regards,\\
John Muller
